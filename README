this is a complete implementation of net-snmp perl subagent.

it can be used to execute arbitrary commands and provide its results via snmp.

3 functions provided to monitor ntp, httpd and core files ( see snmpd-poller-base.functions ):
monitorNtp, monitorHttpd, monitorCore

functions can be  provided in a file with .function extention 
function template:
 
sub monitorSomething {
  my $base=shift;
  my $arg=shift; #optional
  my $t=gettimeofday();
  my $cmd="mycmd  $cmd_timeout $arg|";
  my @r;
  unless (open(HTTPD, $cmd))
    { logMessage(LOG_ERR, "can't process $cmd"); }
  while (<HTTPD>) {
    chomp;
#
#
# populate @r with results 
# result have to be a number. 
#
#
  }
  close(HTTPD);
  $t=gettimeofday()-$t;
  $r[0]='-1' if $#r < 0;
  return fmtRes($base, $cmd, $t, @r);
}

add a line in snmpd-poller-functions.conf:
function=77,   monitorSomething,   <optional arg>

run ( for tested platforms see INSTALL )
snmpd-poller debug

if the command works without errors and output the required results,
than the function is ready to be configured in snmpd service.
